    "\n",
    "**Assignment Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will demonstrate your proficiency in designing a basic banking system using object-oriented programming principles in Python. You will create a class to represent bank accounts and perform fundamental banking operations. The primary objective of this exercise is to practice the definition of classes using a real-life example, specifically, a simple banking system. This exercise aims to familiarize individuals with the concept of class definitions, setting the foundation for subsequent topics in the introduction to digital engineering.\n",

    "**Part 1: Defining the Account Class**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a Python class named `Account` with the following attributes:\n",
    "   - `account_number` (str): A unique identifier for each account.\n",
    "   - `holder_name` (str): The name of the account holder.\n",
    "   - `balance` (float): The initial account balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The class should be defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Account:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, account_number, holder_name, balance):\n",
    "           \"\"\"\n",
    "           Initializes an Account object.\n",

    "           # Implementation details here\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implement the following methods within the `Account` class:\n",
    "   - `deposit(amount)`: This method allows the addition of funds to the account. It should print deposit transaction details.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `withdraw(amount)`: This method enables the deduction of funds from the account, ensuring that withdrawals do not exceed the current balance. It should print withdrawal transaction details.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `display_account_info()`: This function displays detailed information about the account, including the account number, holder name, and current balance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Use the provided `Account` class to perform the following actions:\n",

    "1. Create two distinct instances of accounts using the `Account` class, as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Create accounts\n",
    "   account1 = Account(\"12345\", \"Alice\", 1000.0)\n",
    "   account2 = Account(\"67890\", \"Bob\", 500.0)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Perform transactions on these accounts using the `deposit()` and `withdraw()` methods, as demonstrated in the provided code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Display account information for each account using the `display_account_info()` function, as illustrated in the code provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example ouput:**\n",
    "\n",
